Car Sales Data Analysis in C++

# Car Sales Analysis (C++)

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a **C++ solution** to analyze a large, real-world–style CSV dataset containing global car sales information.

The solution focuses on:
- Correct CSV parsing (including quoted fields)
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Use of simple data structures
- Robust handling of imperfect / dirty data
- Readable and maintainable C++ code

The project was implemented as part of a technical case study.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Using the provided car sales dataset, the program answers the following questions:

1. **How many Audi cars were sold in China in 2025?**
2. **What is the total revenue generated by BMW in 2025?**
3. **What is the distribution of Audi and BMW sales across European countries (sorted)?**

## 🧠 Solution Approach

- The CSV file is processed **row by row** (single pass).
- All columns are parsed correctly, including quoted fields containing commas.
- Only the required fields are used for analysis.
- Business logic is separated from file parsing logic.
- Results are aggregated using standard C++ containers.
